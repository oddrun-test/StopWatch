### Technical Interview

The technical interview consists of writing a small android application. Please use this repository to push your answer.
You have __35 minutes__ to complete this task.

### Notes

- Your app must compile!
- Please make sure that it runs on Android __API 21+__
- __Don't put much time in the UI.__ We're looking for the ways that you tackle the problem, not the tinker-bells!
- It's OK if you didn't finish some of the features. Just try to implement as much as you can in a __clean and structured manner__

### The problem

Write a simple stop-watch application which has the following features:
- A text to show the time in the following format: __HH:MM:SS:MMM__ (hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds)
- A button which toggles the stop-watch. If it's paused it will resume the watch and if it's running it will pause the watch
- A button which resets the stop-watch. It means that this button will reset the text to __00:00:00:000__ and also stops the watch from running
- The watch should continue running if the app goes into background. It means when the user gets back to the app, the watch should include the time that the app was in background, too.


__Good luck and happy coding!__
